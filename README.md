# Sebastian's Projects Repository

Welcome to the repository for my two MLS projects!

## Project 1: Predicting Expected Goals and Assists

In this project, I focus on building a predictive model to estimate expected goals (xG) and expected assists (xA) for players in the MLS.

### Key Features:
- Analysis of player match data to predict xG and xA
- Use of mixed effects modeling for 2021-2025 data

## Project 2: Identifying Attacking Talent

This project aims to identify and evaluate attacking talent, with the goal of uncovering players with potential based on their contributions and style of play.

### Key Features:
- Use of player event data to identify attacking attributes
- Identification of key metrics such as shots, dribbles, key passes, and more
